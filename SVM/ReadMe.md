# Support Vector Machine

In Machine Learning area, Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised learning method that analyze data for classification. It aims to find the **_hyperplane_** which can seperate data into different regions. 

When data is linear sperateable, SVM can be reduced to **Linear Classification**. When data is not linear sperateable, **kernel trick** is used to project data points to a higher dimensional space until the data is "linear sperateable". Below is a simple explanation of how kernel works to
