# Regression Analysis

Regression analysis is a predictive modeling technique which investigates the relationship among variables. It aims to find the **_causal effect relationship_** between a dependent variable ('target' or 'label') and one or more indenpendent variables ('predictors').

Regression analysis is an important tool for analyzing data. Here, we fit a curve to the data points, while the difference between the distaces of data points from the curve is mimimized (try to make the curve as close as possible to the original data points).

Below is an example of how regression used among stock analysis.
